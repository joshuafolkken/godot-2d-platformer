## What is godot-2d-platformer?

I studied Godot by reading the tutorial “[A Super Introductory Guide: Experience the Fun of Game Development! Creating a 2D Platformer with Godot](https://zenn.dev/hathle/books/godot-platfomer-book)” and made some minor arrangements to it.

I tried implementing dash and high jump by holding the button, just like in Mario! I even added double jump in midair!

## How to Play

- Move: A / D, <- / ->
- Jump: B, SPACE
- DASH: V, SHIFT
- START: F
- RESET: R
